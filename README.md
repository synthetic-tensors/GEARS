Modified GEARS repo for a preliminary genetic perturbation model baseline and for prototyping inference.

Model weights and necessary files are stored here: `s3://syntensor-labs-data/inference/GEARS/`

An example of how to perform inference using the weights and files in this S3 bucket is in [InferenceNotebook.ipynb](https://github.com/synthetic-tensors/GEARS/blob/master/InferenceNotebook.ipynb)
